remembered_evals:

A library to make debugging eval'ed code possible.  It monkey patches Kernel.eval, module_eval, and class_eval to save eval'ed code to a file at ._remembered_evals/hash_of_that_file

Thus you can debug [ex: using ruby-debug] THROUGH eval'ed code, now, as well as see appropriate (better) eval'ed code lines in exception backtraces.

Note that if all you want to do is save the code away [not debug through] then you can 
set
SCRIPT_LINES__ = {}
somewhere in your script.

Note also that it breaks eval'ed code that assumes the default binding, i.e.
a = 3
eval("a = 4") # breaks
eval("a = 4", binding) # works though

The price we pay for debugging convenience.
