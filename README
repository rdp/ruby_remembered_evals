remembered_evals:

library to save away eval'ed code to a file first, so that it can be seen later [ex: while debugging]

it monkey patches Kernel.eval to save eval'ed strings to a file at .remembered_evals/hash_of_that_file

Thus you can debug [ex: using ruby-debug] THROUGH eval'ed code, now, as well as see appropriate eval'ed code lines in exception backtraces.

Note that if all you want to do is save the code away [not debug through] then you can 
set
SCRIPT_LINES__ = {}
somewhere in your script.
